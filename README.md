# Making my own OS

## Motivation

Basically, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko) and more specifically [this part of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko&t=2123s). By the time, computers doesn't have operational systems. So, Ken Thompson did one in **3 weeks**. I don't know about you, but I couldn't do a operational system even if I wanted.

In short, I created this repository with the objective to learn more about operational system, and how to computer works, in general.
